    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I grew up in a small town and started operating farm equipment for a summer job after I turned 15. In 2007 I earned my high school diploma. I continued to operate and work on farm equipment after high school until I turned 25. I decided that I wanted to pursue other interests and decided I wanted to learn how computers work, how software is developed, and how computers communicate with one another. I decided to attend <abbr title="Oregon Institute of Technology">OIT</abbr> in Klamath falls. I started out going for a degree in Hardware Engineering. At the end of my first year we were asked to lock in our majors; I changed my target degree to Software Engineering Technology. While at Oregon Tech, I signed up for the MECOP internship program which helped me get two 6-month internships. My first internship was at Intel as an Automated Testing Intern, and my second internship was at Portland General Electric as a DevOps Intern. I graduated from Oregon Institute of Technology with a BS in Software Engineering Technology in March of 2020.</p>
